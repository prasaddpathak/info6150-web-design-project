# Project Description-

As of now, we don't have a webpage or an application that allows user2 to stream songs and book your event tickets. This proposed project intends to provide users with a good listening experience and to be able to attend social events according to their music taste. The website will have a login page, user must provide their authenticated user ID and password. A user would be able to create an account. The website will allow the users to create their playlist as they want, they can mark their favorites. The website will make a shuffle list according to the user's taste for a better listening experience. The website will allow users to listen to the radio 24*7.  The website will allow users to switch between light and dark modes. The website will play the music and it will also allow the user to manage the progress bar for that song, if a user wants to listen to the same bit, again and again, they can surely do that. The website will allow users to adjust the volume on the screen as well. The website will allow users to find social events or live concerts according to their music taste so that they can enjoy themselves and socialize with people after a post-covid environment.
